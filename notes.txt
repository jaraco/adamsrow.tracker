To configure the mail gateway, I had to create a Scheduled Task, which
I exported as "Adams Row Tracker Mail Gateway.xml".

Later, I created this script that the scheduler runs:
"""
import sys

import win32traceutil
from roundup.scripts.roundup_mailgw import run

print("Checking mail...")

sys.argv[1:] = [
	r"C:\Inetpub\Adams Row Tracker",
	"pops",
	"tracker@adamsrowcondo.org:33eanFqm@pop.gmail.com",
]
run()
"""
